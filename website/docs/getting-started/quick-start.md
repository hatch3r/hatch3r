# Quick Start

Get hatch3r running in your project in under a minute.

## Install

```bash
npx hatch3r init
```

That's it. hatch3r detects your repo, asks which tools you use, and generates everything.

## What happens during init

1. **Detects your repository** -- reads `git remote` for owner/repo info
2. **Asks which tools** -- select from Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, OpenCode, Windsurf, Amp, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cline, Aider, Kiro, Goose, Zed
3. **Asks about MCP servers** -- optionally configure GitHub, Context7, Filesystem, Playwright, Brave Search
4. **Generates canonical source** -- creates `/.agents/` with all agents, skills, rules, and commands
5. **Generates tool configs** -- adapts canonical source to native formats for each selected tool
6. **Creates `.env.mcp`** -- secret placeholder file (gitignored) for MCP server credentials

## Next steps after init

| Starting point | Command | What it does |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| New project | `project-spec` | Generate documentation from your project vision |
| Existing codebase | `codebase-map` | Analyze and reverse-engineer specifications |
| Single feature | `feature-plan` | Plan one feature in depth |
| Complex bug | `bug-plan` | Investigate and plan a fix |
| Any project | `roadmap` | Create a phased roadmap from specs |

After planning, the typical flow is:

```
board-init → todo.md → board-fill → board-pickup → review → release
```

See the [Workflow guide](../guides/workflow) for the full lifecycle.

## CLI Commands

```bash
npx hatch3r init          # Interactive setup
npx hatch3r sync          # Re-generate from canonical state
npx hatch3r update        # Pull latest templates (safe merge)
npx hatch3r status        # Check sync status
npx hatch3r validate      # Validate .agents/ structure
```

## MCP Setup

If you selected MCP servers during init, fill in your API keys:

```bash
# .env.mcp (generated by hatch3r init)
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
BRAVE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
```

How secrets are loaded depends on your editor:

- **VS Code / Copilot** -- Loads automatically from `.env.mcp` via the native `envFile` field
- **Cursor / Claude Code / others** -- Source before launching:

```bash
set -a && source .env.mcp && set +a && cursor .
```

See [MCP Setup](../guides/mcp-setup) for full details.
