# Learning Consultation

Before implementing any task, check `/.agents/learnings/` for relevant past learnings.

## Consultation Process

1. If `/.agents/learnings/` exists and contains files:
   - Scan learning file frontmatter for matching `tags` or `area` that overlap with the current task.
   - Read the `## Applies When` section of potential matches.
   - Surface relevant learnings to the developer/agent before implementation begins.
2. If no learnings directory exists, skip silently.

## Integration Points

- During `hatch3r-board-pickup` Step 6: consult learnings before implementation delegation.
- During `hatch3r-board-fill` Step 4: consult learnings when scoping and estimating issues.
- During any skill execution: check for relevant pitfalls before coding.

## Learning Priority

- **Pitfalls** are highest priority -- always surface these.
- **Patterns** are surfaced when the current task matches their trigger conditions.
- **Decisions** are surfaced when the current task might conflict with a past decision.
