# Accessibility Standards

## WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance

All user-facing features must meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance. This is the baseline — Level AAA is aspirational for critical user flows.

## Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via keyboard alone.
- Tab order follows the visual reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom for LTR languages).
- Never use `tabindex` values greater than 0. Use `tabindex="0"` to add to natural flow, `tabindex="-1"` for programmatic focus only.
- Custom widgets implement standard keyboard patterns: arrow keys for navigation within a group, Enter/Space for activation, Escape to dismiss.
- Keyboard traps are forbidden. Every focused element must have a keyboard-accessible exit.
- Skip navigation links appear as the first focusable element on pages with repeated navigation.

## Focus Management

- Focus is visible at all times. Custom focus indicators must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio against the background.
- When content changes dynamically (modals, drawers, toasts), move focus to the new content.
- When a modal or dialog closes, return focus to the element that triggered it.
- Single-page application route changes move focus to the main content heading or a skip link target.
- Never remove focus outlines globally. If overriding browser defaults, provide an equally visible alternative.

## Color and Contrast

- Text contrast ratio: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold).
- Non-text contrast: minimum 3:1 for UI components (borders, icons, form controls) and graphical objects.
- Never convey information through color alone. Use additional indicators: icons, text labels, patterns.
- Test with color blindness simulators (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia).
- Dark mode and light mode must independently meet contrast requirements.

## Screen Reader Support

- All images have meaningful `alt` text or `alt=""` for decorative images.
- Form controls have associated `<label>` elements (using `for`/`id` or wrapping).
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) before reaching for ARIA roles.
- Dynamic content updates use `aria-live` regions: `polite` for non-urgent updates, `assertive` for critical alerts.
- Tables have `<caption>` and use `<th scope="col|row">` for header cells.
- Icon-only buttons include `aria-label` or visually hidden text.

## ARIA Patterns

- Follow the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) for all custom widgets.
- ARIA role must match keyboard behavior — a `role="button"` element must respond to Enter and Space.
- Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `aria-checked` to communicate widget state.
- `aria-describedby` links error messages and help text to form controls.
- Avoid ARIA when native HTML provides the same semantics. First rule of ARIA: don't use ARIA if native HTML works.
- Test ARIA implementations with at least two screen readers (VoiceOver + NVDA or JAWS).

## Motion and Animation

- All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Disable non-essential motion.
- Essential animations (progress indicators, loading states) simplify rather than disable entirely.
- No content flashes more than 3 times per second (seizure safety — WCAG 2.3.1).
- Auto-playing media has a visible pause/stop mechanism.

## Forms and Input

- Group related form controls with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.
- Error messages identify the field in error and describe how to fix it.
- Required fields are indicated both visually and programmatically (`aria-required="true"` or `required`).
- Input validation provides feedback inline and in an error summary.
- Time limits are either removable, adjustable (10x minimum), or preceded by a warning with option to extend.

## Testing with Assistive Technology

- Test with a screen reader on every feature branch that modifies UI.
- Minimum testing matrix: VoiceOver (macOS/iOS) + Chrome, NVDA + Firefox (Windows).
- Run automated accessibility checks (axe-core, Lighthouse) in CI.
- Automated tools catch ~30% of accessibility issues. Manual testing is required for keyboard flows, screen reader experience, and cognitive accessibility.
- Maintain an accessibility test checklist per component type (form, modal, navigation, data table).
